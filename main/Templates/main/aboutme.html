        I am a third year computer science student at Northeastern University. I had not touched programming until
        I tried a fundementals course in the summer of Freshman year. I fell in love instantly
        <img class ="inline_image" src="{% static 'heart.png' %}">
        and switched my degree next semester.
        My courses have taught me the foundations of CS. Online tutorials and personal projects have taught me specific
        languages and frameworks.

    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <h4>History</h4>
            <p>
                I have always been fascinated by the stories of our past. The sheer variety of cultures and socities
                is amazing. If catastrophe wipes out the Internet Age I would try my hand as a history professor.
                <a>Dan Carlin's Hardcore History Podcast</a> is my favorite historical storytelling.
                <a>The History of the World in Eight Glasses</a> demonstrates that simple products can change the world.
            </p>
        <h4>Reading</h4>
            <p>
                When I was little I used to try and sneak books into family dinners. There is still something magical
                about opening a book, turning its page, and entering another world. Science Fiction, Fantasy and History
                are my favorite genres. I like immersing myself in a different place and time. When I want to learn something
                well, I buy the book for it.
                <ol>
                    <p>Top five books.</p>
                    <li>Stormlight Archive</li>
                    <li>Brave New World</li>
                    <li>Starship Troopers</li>
                    <li>Fight Club</li>
                    <li>The Black Company</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        <h4>Boardgames</h4>
            <p>
                Nothing strains friendships more than playing a good board game. Maybe its the intrigue and betrayal,
                the stategic decision making, or childhood Monopoly memories but I cannot get enough of that stuff.
